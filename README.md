# Summary

For this challenge a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes was generated to retrieve nearest cities.  A Google API call was used with the OpenWeatherMap to find the maximum temperature, percent humidity, percent cloudiness, wind speed, and weather description for the random set of latitudes and longitudes.  A dataframe was created to store the data in a CSV file.  Next input statements were used to retrieve customer weather preferences based on minimum and maximum weather temperatures.  This helps to narrow potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.  Then a marker layer map with pop-up markers was created.  Next 4 locations in Brazil were selected based on customer criteria and a travel itinerary was created.  The marker layer map with pop-up markers was created to show hotels in the 4 locations in Brazil.
